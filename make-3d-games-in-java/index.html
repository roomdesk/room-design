Java 3d game engine tutorial From pferdewetten-online.net
I�m trying to figure out if it is possible to make a 3ds game with java, maybe a library to detect input plus some converter or something to convert.jar into.3ds. Decide what winning means, then redraw the whole canvas with a celebration graphic. Java is a bit slower then c&#43;&#43; however this effect is less then people tend to think. Using a similar technique, they were able to push real time 3d graphics on very early hardware.
